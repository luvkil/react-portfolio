## About This Portfolio

I ccreated this portfolio to show my work and what I am capable of doing. The design of this portfolio is simple<br>
and navigation is made easy. I include my first **group project** along with two other previous homework assignments,<br>
an **updated resume** and **contact** information.

### How To Navigate

- click  the project link on the navigation bar to projects and assingnments<br>
- click on collaborators to view the participants of the project and links to their github profile<br>
- click on resume for an updated resume and contacts for contact information<br>
